# webdev
A bunch of random HTML, CSS, and Javascript demos and example code I've written or snagged from around the net.

## HTML
HTML5 demos that are meant to be run in the browser (obviously, I guess?)

## Javascript
Javascript demos that are meant to be run in the browser console (Chrome and Firefox) or in Firefox scratchpad. Some / most of these can also be ran via node.js in the command line as well.

## Lightning Components Trailhead
This code is all from the Lightning Components Basics Trailhead
- https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/module/lex_dev_lc_basics

## node.js
Node.js demo code that can be run in the command line via `node filename`.

## TypeScript Tutorials
This code is all based off of code from the official TypeScript documentation page.
- http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/tutorial.html

## web-components
Demo code for Web Components
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components
- https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/first-element/intro

## webserver
A basic node.js server running Express, Helmet, and Nodemon.
Use 'npm install' to install the node components and then `npm start` to start nodemon or just `node server.js` to start the server without nodemon.
Currently using this to test a Progressive Web App soundboard and a random WebWorkers demo, both in the "public/" folder.
