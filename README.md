# webdev
A bunch of random HTML, CSS, and Javascript demos and example code I've written or snagged from around the net.

***

## HTML
HTML5 demos that are meant to be run in the browser (obviously, I guess?)

## Javascript
Javascript demos that are meant to be run in the browser console (Chrome and Firefox) or in Firefox scratchpad. Some / most of these can also be ran via node.js in the command line as well.

## node.js
Node.js demo code that can be run in the command line via `node filename`.

## Tutorials
A bunch of Javascript and general web development tutorials I've done.

### Typescript
- This code is all based off of code from the official TypeScript documentation page.

## web-components
Demo code for Web Components

- Polymer 3: https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/first-element/intro
- Lit Element: https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide/start

## webserver
A basic node.js server running Express, Helmet, and Nodemon.
Use 'npm install' to install the node components and then `npm start` to start nodemon or just `node server.js` to start the server without nodemon.
Currently using this to test a Progressive Web App soundboard and a random WebWorkers demo, both in the "public/" folder.
